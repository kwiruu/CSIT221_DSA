# Point - Rectangle
by Jay Vince Serato

Two points, when connected using horizontal and vertical lines, will form a rectangle.


In the rectangle.h file, create the Rectangle struct that contains two Points. Since this will use the Point struct, don't forget to include it as a header file.


With this, you will also be able to calculate for the rectangle's area and perimeter. Also create these methods that will accept no arguments return int.

### Sample Output 1

    Enter x of rectangle point 1: 5
    Enter y of rectangle point 1: 2
    Enter x of rectangle point 2: 10
    Enter y of rectangle point 2: 10

    Perimeter of the rectangle: 26
    Area of the rectangle: 40

### Sample Output 2

    Enter x of rectangle point 1: 10
    Enter y of rectangle point 1: 10
    Enter x of rectangle point 2: 5
    Enter y of rectangle point 2: 2

    Perimeter of the rectangle: 26
    Area of the rectangle: 40

### Sample Output 3

    Enter x of rectangle point 1: 0
    Enter y of rectangle point 1: 0
    Enter x of rectangle point 2: 4
    Enter y of rectangle point 2: 4

    Perimeter of the rectangle: 16
    Area of the rectangle: 16
