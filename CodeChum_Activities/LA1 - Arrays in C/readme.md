#### Note:

This activity is just creating, storing, finding inside of an array:

    When you add a element to the array you have to allocate the array 
    when you hit a certain limit of the capacity of the array like: If 
    you add 4 element and the capacity of the array is only 5 you have 
    to allocate it to fit more elements. Finding is simple just input 
    the index.
